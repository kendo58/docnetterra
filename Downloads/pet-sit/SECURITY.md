# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability, please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead, report it privately by emailing the maintainers with:

- A description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Any suggested mitigation or patch

## Supported versions

Only the latest `main` branch is supported with security updates.
